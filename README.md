Creation of a web interface presenting a quote as well as the photo and name of its author.

The goal is to have a new quote each time the page is refreshed. This change of citation is done thanks to an asynchronous request retrieving the information in a `.json` file. The information retrieved is incorporated into the file through a DOM manipulation.
